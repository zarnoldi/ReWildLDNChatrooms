At our charity, we are passionate about rewilding and restoring natural habitats in the greater London area and surrounding home counties. Our mission is to research, fund, and carry out rewilding projects that will benefit both the environment and the communities that live in these areas.

We believe that by restoring natural habitats and reintroducing native species, we can create healthier and more diverse ecosystems that support a wide range of flora and fauna. This, in turn, can improve the overall health and well-being of our communities by providing cleaner air, water, and food, and creating spaces for people to connect with nature.

Our approach to rewilding is grounded in scientific research and community engagement. We work with local experts and volunteers to identify areas that are most in need of restoration, and we collaborate with other organizations to maximize the impact of our work.

Through our fundraising efforts, we are able to provide the necessary resources to carry out these projects, including funding for materials, equipment, and personnel. We are committed to transparency and accountability, and we regularly report on our progress and the impact of our work.

If you share our passion for rewilding and restoring natural habitats in the greater London area and surrounding home counties, we invite you to join us in our mission. Together, we can create a more sustainable and resilient future for our communities and the planet.
